## Requirements

It’s a good idea to first make sure that your web server meets the minimum requirements to run TubePress:

* PHP 5.3.29 **without** the [APC extension ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PHP_accelerators#Alternative_PHP_Cache_.28APC.29)
 
* WordPress 3.0

Please note that these are the minimum requirements and TubePress will also work with all later versions of PHP and WordPress. Not sure if your server meets these requirements? You should either:

1. Ask your hosting provider or 
 
2. Install a WordPress plugin that prints out your system information. Here are some examples: 
 
    * [WordPress phpinfo()](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-php-info/)
    * [WP-ServerInfo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-serverinfo/)
 
## Download

1. Visit [the Downloads page](https://dashboard.tubepress.com/downloads) in the TubePress Dashboard. **If you've already paid for TubePress Pro, please skip to step 5.** 
 
2. On the Downloads page, you'll see a list of available downloads with TubePress Pro at the top. You may download the free trial version of TubePress here, or you may click the "Buy Now" button when you are ready to buy.

## Upload

TubePress can be installed just like any other WordPress plugin, though since we don’t distribute through the [wordpress.org plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/), you’ll have to install the plugin manually. Thankfully, [WordPress provides excellent documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) on how to manually install plugins.

### Manual FTP Upload

1. [Download TubePress](#download) as a zip file to your local machine. 
 
2. Unzip the file. 
 
3. With your FTP program, upload the unzipped folder to the `wp-content/plugins` folder in your WordPress directory on your web server. 
 
4. Go to `WP Admin > Plugins` and find TubePress in your plugin list. 
 
5. Click **Activate Plugin** to activate it.

If you are using TubePress Pro, you may want to proceed with these [optional installations](#optional).

### Alternative Upload Method

If you would rather not use FTP to upload TubePress, you may attempt to install the plugin directly from within the WordPress administration panel. This method *may* also be faster than using FTP.

1. [Download TubePress](/docs/page/download) as a zip file to your local machine. 
 
2. From your WordPress admin dashboard, click the link at Plugins > Add New

    ![Add new plugin link](../img/install/plugins-add-new.png)
 
3. At the top of the page, click the "Upload Plugin" link.

If you are using TubePress Pro, you may want to proceed with the optional installations outlined below.
 
## Optional Installations

<Message info>
    <Message.Header>
        Note
    </Message.Header>
    
This section only applies to TubePress Pro users. If you are using the free trial version of the plugin, you can safely skip this section.

Due to licensing restrictions, TubePress Pro does not ship with every library that the free trial plugin includes. However, these optional libraries may be installed manually as follows:

### JW Player (version 5.x)

TubePress can use [JW Player](http://www.jwplayer.com/) 5.10 to play YouTube videos. We are working to integrate JW Player 7.x, but this feature is not yet ready for production.

1. Download the file player.swf from [here](https://github.com/tubepress/tubepress/raw/v4.0.0/src/add-ons/jwplayer5/web/player.swf). 
 
2. Upload the file to your TubePress Pro installation at

    `wp-content/tubepress-content/vendor/jwplayer/v5/player.swf`
   
    You may need to create the `vendor` directory and its subdirectories.

### Shadowbox.js

1. Download Shadowbox.js from [here](http://tubepress-cdn.com/shadowboxjs/shadowbox-3.0.3.zip). 
 
2. The download will save to a file named shadowbox-3.0.3.zip. Unzip this file, and it will expand into a directory named `shadowbox-3.0.3`. 
 
3. Copy the **contents** of this directory (**not** the directory itself) to your TubePress Pro installation at `wp-content/tubepress-content/vendor/shadowboxjs/v3/`. You may need to create the `vendor` directory and its subdirectories. 
 
4. *Optional*. You may see scrollbars in the Shadowbox.js display. To fix this, simply edit `shadowbox.css`. On line 8, remove the `overflow:auto` attribute, i.e. change it from 
 
    ```css
    #sb-player.html{height:100%;overflow:auto;}
    ```

    to 
 
    ```css
    #sb-player.html{height:100%;}
    ```
