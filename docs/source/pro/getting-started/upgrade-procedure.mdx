## Manual

This page details the **manual** procedure to upgrade TubePress from one version to another.

!!! Note
    Since TubePress 4.2.0, [automated updates](/docs/page/enable-automatic-plugin-updates) are available. We strongly suggest that you use automated updates to save time and frustration. If you are upgrading from a version of TubePress previous to 4.2.0, you'll need to follow the manual procedure described below.

1. Unzip the file.
 
1. With your FTP program, upload the unzipped folder to the `wp-content/plugins` folder in your WordPress directory on your web server. If you would prefer to not use FTP, you may use the "alternative" installation technique described in the [installation documentation](/docs/page/installation).
 
1. Go to WP Admin &gt; Plugins and find TubePress in your plugin list. Ensure that you are viewing "All" plugins.
