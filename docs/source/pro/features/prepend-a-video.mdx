title: Prepend a video
description: 'Start off a gallery with a custom video'

On any page that is showing a TubePress gallery, TubePress allows you to identify an arbitrary video that you'd like to prepend to the gallery. This is useful if you'd like to share a link to a specific video, or include a video that otherwise wouldn't be in the gallery.

To use this feature, you simply need to add `tubepress_item` to the URL of a page with TubePress, and set its value to the ID of the video that you'd like to prepend. Below are some examples:

`http://foo.bar/videos?tubepress_item=K34RS6M11uw` 
This would prepend the YouTube video with ID `K34RS6M11uw` to any gallery on the page. 
 
`http://something.com/gallery?page=2&amp;tubepress_item=131240951` 
This would prepend the Vimeo video with ID `131240951` to any gallery on the page.
